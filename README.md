## Security 
SDU does not allow VPN access to students and professors. Therefore, we will connect to the computer with a GPU as a remote computer. 
Only a single user can connect to the computer at a time. Also, all users can access to all aplications installed in the computer. 

**Please log out from all applications that you used during your session, so other users will not have access to your credentials!**
